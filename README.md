# Malware-Detection
  - Abstract: <br>
a versatile framework in which one can employ different machine learning algorithms to successfully distinguish between malware files and clean files. During the research, a unique set of features was chosen, and then three attribute selection algorithms and five classification algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, K-NN, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier ) were examined to choose algorithms that would provide the most effective rate of malware detection.
  - Steps for Proposed Methodology:
      - Pre-Processing
          - Data Cleaning
          - Label Encoding
          - Check for unique values of categorical features
          - Remove duplicates
      - Model Evaluation
          - ExtraTreesClassifier
          - Random Forest
          - PCA
          - Cross-Validation
              - SVM
              - KNN
              - Decision Tree Classifier
              - Logistic Regression
      - GridSearch for finding the Best parameters
  - Conclusion: <br>
The main target was to come up with a machine-learning framework that generically detects as many malware samples as it can. Five classification algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, K-NN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier ). We obtained the highest scores on the percentage of correctly classified instances (99% accuracy for Random forest).
